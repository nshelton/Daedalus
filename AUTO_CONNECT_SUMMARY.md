# Auto-Connect Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

Implemented auto-connect functionality on application startup and dynamic connection status display.

## Changes Made

### `src/renderer.ts`

**New Features:**

1. **Auto-Connect on Startup** (`autoConnectPlotter()`)
   - Automatically searches for plotter port on app startup
   - Uses `window.electronAPI.findPlotterPort()` to detect EBB/Arduino devices
   - Updates status to "Searching..." â†’ "Connecting..." â†’ "Connected (port)" or "Disconnected"
   - Automatically connects if a plotter is found

2. **Port Refresh** (`refreshPorts()`)
   - Loads all available serial ports
   - Displays port path and manufacturer in dropdown
   - Shows "Loading..." state during refresh
   - Handles errors gracefully

3. **Connection Management**
   - `connect()` - Connects to selected port with selected baud rate
   - `disconnect()` - Safely disconnects from port
   - `toggleConnection()` - Toggles between connected/disconnected states
   - Disables port/baud rate selectors while connected

4. **Enhanced Status Display** (`updateConnectionStatus()`)
   - Accepts optional text parameter for custom status messages
   - Updates both status indicator (colored dot) and status text
   - Shows dynamic states: "Searching...", "Connecting...", "Connected (portname)", "Disconnected", "Connection Failed", etc.

5. **Event Listeners**
   - Connect button toggle
   - Port selection changes
   - Serial data listener setup

## User Experience Flow

1. **On Startup:**
   ```
   "Disconnected" â†’ "Searching..." â†’ "Connecting..." â†’ "Connected (/dev/ttyUSB0)"
   ```
   OR
   ```
   "Disconnected" â†’ "Searching..." â†’ "Disconnected" (if no plotter found)
   ```

2. **Status Indicator (Top Right):**
   - ðŸ”´ Red dot = Disconnected
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green dot = Connected
   - Text shows detailed status and port name when connected

3. **Manual Control:**
   - User can still manually select a different port and connect
   - "Connect" button changes to "Disconnect" when connected
   - Port and baud rate selectors disabled during connection

## Technical Details

### Auto-Detection Logic

Uses `SerialController.findPlotterPort()` which looks for:
- Arduino boards (VID: 2341)
- CH340 chips (VID: 1a86)
- CP210x chips (VID: 10c4)
- FTDI chips
- Any device with manufacturer matching: arduino, ch340, cp210, ftdi

### Status Messages

| State | Status Text | Indicator Color |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Initial | "Disconnected" | Red |
| Searching | "Searching..." | Red |
| Connecting | "Connecting..." | Red |
| Connected | "Connected (/dev/ttyUSB0)" | Green |
| Failed | "Connection Failed" | Red |
| Error | "Error" | Red |
| Disconnecting | "Disconnecting..." | Red |

### Connection Settings

- Default baud rate: **115200** (required for EBB)
- Baud rate options: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600
- Port selection from auto-detected list

## Files Modified

- `src/renderer.ts` - Complete rewrite of connection logic

## Files Compiled

- `dist/renderer.js` - Compiled JavaScript output

## Testing

To test the auto-connect:

1. **With Plotter Connected:**
   - Connect AxiDraw/EggBot to USB
   - Launch app
   - Should see: "Searching..." â†’ "Connecting..." â†’ "Connected (/dev/ttyXXX)"
   - Green indicator in top right

2. **Without Plotter:**
   - Launch app with no plotter connected
   - Should see: "Searching..." â†’ "Disconnected"
   - Red indicator in top right

3. **Manual Connect:**
   - Click "Refresh" to update port list
   - Select desired port
   - Click "Connect"
   - Status updates accordingly

## Next Steps

The app now:
âœ… Auto-connects to plotter on startup  
âœ… Shows dynamic connection status in top right  
âœ… Allows manual port selection and connection  
âœ… Properly enables/disables controls based on state  
âœ… Handles connection errors gracefully  

Ready to use with the PlotterController for actual plotting operations!
