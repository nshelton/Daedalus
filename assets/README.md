# Assets Directory

Place your application icons here:

- `icon.png` - For Linux builds (256x256 or 512x512 recommended)
- `icon.ico` - For Windows builds
- `icon.icns` - For macOS builds

You can use tools like [electron-icon-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-icon-builder) to generate these from a single PNG file.

For now, the application will work without custom icons and use the default Electron icon.
